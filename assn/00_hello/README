This problem is just for you to practice using
the assignment submission system.

(1) Create a file called "hello.txt"  (inside this directory, not quotes)
(2) Write one line, which says "hello" (no quotes).
(3) Add it to git
  git add hello.txt
(4) Commit it to git
  git commit 
(5) Push your commits to the remote repository (i.e., turn it in)
  git push
(6) Grade the assignment
  grade 00_hello

(7) Obtain the next assignment, and your detailed grade reports by pulling from git

  git pull

   You should get a file called "grade.txt" which will contain details about your score 
   (there isn't much to say for this assignment).
   You should also have another directory 01_ch01rq (cd ../01_ch01rq) which is your
   reading quiz for chapter 1.  Now go do that assignment.
