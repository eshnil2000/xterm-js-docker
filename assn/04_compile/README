For this assignment, you will be practicing writing, compiling, and
running code.  You should write a C file with a main function
that uses the printf function to print the message

Hello World

[be sure to include a newline!]

Your program should return 0 to indicate that it was successful
(the return value of main indicates success [0] or failure [anything else]).

Also, you will need to put

#include <stdio.h>

at the start of your code. This includes the header file which tells
the compiler about printf.  You will learn more about header files
in an upcoming lesson!
