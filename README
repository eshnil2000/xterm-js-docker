Welcome to your programming environment.

You will be using git to store and submit your code.
You'll learn more about git as you go, but for now, run the command

git pull

This will get the most recent code from the remote repository,
which will include your first assignment.

After you do that, if you run ls, you should see a directory called

00_hello


cd into that directory (cd 00_hello) and run ls there.  You should
see a file called README which has the instructions for the first assignment.

You can read the instructions by either running

cat README

or

emacs README
